"""Check the decision stage's execution boundary against its consumers' grants.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_execution_boundary.py

`plugins/code-review/skills/decision-gate/SKILL.md` states, in prose, what a
verification check may execute during the decision stage. The commands that run
that stage declare `allowed-tools:` in YAML two files away. Nothing compared
them, and twice a fix changed the skill and left a consumer contradicting it.

A naive diff of the two is useless: `allowed-tools:` governs what the command
may do *at all* and legitimately carries `Edit`, `Write`, `Task` and the project
test runners, none of which are boundary violations. What is checkable is
narrower and is the property that actually matters: **a pre-approved `Bash(...)`
grant removes the platform's permission prompt.** For anything the boundary
excludes, that prompt is the last mechanical backstop before a prose lapse
executes something. So this is a registry-parity check, in the shape
`plugins/code-review/scripts/check-prefix-sync.sh` already uses here — a
canonical table in the document that owns the concept, diffed against its
consumers:

  1. Every `Bash(...)` grant on a runs-the-stage consumer is declared and
     classified in the skill's grant registry, and every registry row names a
     grant its consumer really carries.
  2. Every file that mentions the skill is classified in the registry's scope
     table, so a third command that starts running the stage cannot be silently
     unscanned — the blind spot `check_agent_frontmatter.py`'s
     `*/agents/*.md` glob has for commands and skills.
  3. A row claiming `inside-boundary` is verified against the boundary text
     itself, parsed from the skill rather than hardcoded here.
  4. A wildcard over a command family the boundary admits only *partly* —
     `Bash(git:*)` against five named git subcommands — fails. No registry row
     can make the rest of that family prompt-free-and-acceptable.

Errors exit non-zero; warnings print and do not fail the build. Exit 2 is a
usage error or an unparseable source, which is not a failed check.

Frontmatter parsing is imported from `check_agent_frontmatter` rather than
rewritten: that parser is covered by 85 tests, including the comma-and-comment
cases a hand-rolled split gets wrong. Its *glob* and its `_uses_colon_specifier`
are the blind spots; its parser is not.
