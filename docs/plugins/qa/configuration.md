# QA configuration

The `[qa]` table controls source fixes, application writes, service startup, existing users and registered-account cleanup. Use this page to choose policy and add accounts or recipes. See [shared configuration](../../configuration.md) for `.av/` files, `[env]` targets, services, sources, stores and trust.

## Policy

All 3 policy keys are strings. Omitted keys use the defaults below; explicitly configured values are trust-pinned.

| Key | Default | Allowed values and behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `fix` | `"approve"` | `"approve"`: ask before each fix batch. `"auto"`: apply eligible fixes after showing scope. `"off"`: test and report only. |
| `mutations` | `"deny"` | `"deny"`: skip declared or detected writes. `"allow"`: guard nothing; use only when every target's data is disposable. |
| `start_services` | `"ask"` | `"ask"`: ask before needed `up`/`prepare`; headless stops. `"auto"`: show scope, then run configured commands when needed. |

Every frontend and backend scenario needs `- **Writes:** yes|no`. Under `deny`, `yes`, missing or invalid declarations guard the whole scenario. Detected writes also guard the scenario, including preconditions, edges and State Checks; `no` cannot override detection.

Registration and session-writing login count as writes. Guarded scenarios are `SKIP`, never fix candidates. Static detection has [residual risks](../qa.md#residual-risks); `deny` is not a read-only guarantee.

These policies are independent. `fix = "off"` does not prevent application writes or service startup. For restrictive testing, combine `off` and `deny`, and omit service startup/preparation commands.

### Working tree and limits

| `fix` | Pre-existing tracked changes |
|---|---|
| `"approve"` | Warn and ask Proceed/Abort; headless aborts. |
| `"auto"` | Proceed with the recorded baseline. |
| `"off"` | Skip the dirty-tree gate. |

The working-tree baseline records tracked changes present before the run, and QA takes it before any bootstrap writes. QA's own config and ignore edits therefore do not become pre-existing changes.

Recovery never restores the whole tree or pre-existing dirty files; reconcile reported overlap yourself.

A dispatch is 1 assignment to a tester or fixer.

| Fixed limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Fix iterations | `3` |
| Tester/fixer dispatches | `50` |
| Elapsed time | `30 minutes` |

The final full test pass counts toward usage but is not blocked by exhausted fix limits. In headless mode, `approve` tests and reports, but applies no source fixes and skips that final pass. There is no per-fix `step` mode or token/cost ceiling.

Service preparation runs only after QA's own `up`, not against an already-running stack. Use idempotent preparation commands; apply branch migrations yourself when services were already running.

See [QA safety](../qa.md#safety) for fix eligibility and authentication guards.

## Users

`[qa.users.<name>]` configures existing accounts. QA never creates or deletes these accounts.

Names start with a lowercase ASCII letter; remaining characters are lowercase letters, digits or `_`. The names `new`, `captured` and names starting `captured_` are reserved.

| Key | Type | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `email` | Source string | Required email source. |
| `password` | Secret source string | Required password source. |
| `id` | Source string | Optional; needed when the plan references the user's ID. |
| `description` | Non-empty string | Required description of the role or account state. |

Use the [source rules](../../configuration.md#secrets-and-values); never put a password in the plan or committed config.

### Plan declarations

Declare every user under the plan's `## Users` heading:

```markdown
## Users
- owner: registered — plain user who owns a CV
- admin: existing — administrator (qa.users.admin)
```

| Declaration | Use when |
|---|---|
| `registered` | Signup can create the required user. No existing-account configuration is needed. |
| `existing` | Signup cannot create the required role or state. Configure `qa.users.<name>`. |

A configured user must be declared `existing`, not `registered`. Undeclared user references are plan errors. Plans may declare at most `10` registered users.

### Tester-visible references

Plans use `$QA_NAME` or `${QA_NAME}` throughout scenarios, including preconditions and edges.

| Input | Tester-visible reference |
|---|---|
| Existing user `u` | Referenced fields among `QA_<U>_EMAIL`, `QA_<U>_PASSWORD`, `QA_<U>_ID`; ID requires a configured source. Login needs email and password references. |
| Referenced `[env.values]` entry `X` | `QA_<X>` with the name uppercased. |
| Registration password | `QA_NEW_PASSWORD`, generated once per run. |
| Dispatch tag | Plans write `$QA_TAG`, for example `qa+$QA_TAG-owner@test.local`. Testers substitute the `Tag:` value from their dispatch input; it is not a private-channel variable. |
| `[env.secrets]` | Never exposed to testers. |

For registered users, email and ID references hold values from the tester's own registration step. Using them before registration produces `NEED_INFO kind=fixture`, naming the user. Tokens and cookies come from runtime login; never declare token/cookie references in plans.

Value names must not collide with exposed user fields or use `TAG`, `NEW_PASSWORD`, `CAPTURED_*` or token/cookie suffixes. Avoid value names that resemble undeclared user fields, such as `OWNER_EMAIL`.

## Registered accounts

Testers register through the application's signup API or form, then log in themselves. Each tester dispatch supplies a tag; addresses such as `qa+<Tag>-owner@test.local` include that tag. Use an application-supported domain and the generated run password.

Testers record each successful registration immediately in the durable account ledger. Teardown attempts deletion through the configured cleanup recipe. Configured existing accounts are never enrolled for deletion.

Signup rate limits, CAPTCHA or email confirmation can block registration. Supply a local mail catcher when confirmation needs one. Use an existing account when signup cannot produce the required role or state.

## Cleanup

Optional `[qa.cleanup]` contains exactly 1 SQL, HTTP or command recipe. Cleanup deletes tester-registered accounts, never configured existing users. Prefer repository-evidenced deletion by email; verify cascades and related-data deletion before approval.

SQL and HTTP recipes must contain `{email}`. Deletion by ID alone is not allowed. Recorded email addresses must contain the dispatch tag in their local part and differ from the existing-user emails provided to the run.

### SQL recipe

| Key | Type / requirement | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | Required string | `"sql"` |
| `store` | Required string | Configured store with `kind = "sql"`. |
| `query` | Required non-empty string | SQL containing `{email}`. |

Only `{email}`, `{id}` and `{tag}` placeholders are allowed. QA quotes SQL literals and doubles embedded apostrophes; absent IDs become `NULL`. Do not quote placeholders yourself.

Cleanup runs without State Check read-only settings; exit `0` means success. Postgres and MySQL cleanup ignore client startup/option files. Approve the query only after checking the application's deletion contract and foreign-key cascades.

### HTTP recipe

| Key | Type / default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | Required string | `"http"` |
| `target` | Required string | Configured target; HTTPS unless loopback. |
| `method` | Required string | `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` or `OPTIONS`. |
| `path` | Required string | Starts `/`, not `//`; query allowed, backslashes and fragments forbidden. |
| `headers` | String table / `{}` | Request headers. |
| `json` | Table / omitted | Nested JSON-compatible tables, arrays, strings, numbers and booleans. |
| `form` | String table / omitted | URL-encoded form; mutually exclusive with `json`. |
| `expect` | Required non-empty integer array | Successful HTTP statuses, `100` to `599`. |

Templates allow `{email}`, `{id}`, `{tag}`, `{secret.X}` and `{value.X}`. Secret/value names must exist in their `[env]` tables; use placeholders, not source strings, inside recipes.

Identity substitutions in paths and queries are percent-encoded. Header and body substitutions retain raw values. Cleanup never follows redirects.

If `{id}` is required but unavailable, cleanup counts a failed attempt without sending a request.

### Command recipe

| Key | Type / requirement | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | Required string | `"command"` |
| `run` | Required non-empty string | Shell command in the repository root; timeout `60 seconds`. |

Commands use no placeholders and must not print credentials. Exit `0` means success. Commands are trust-pinned, not sandboxed.

QA removes inherited `QA_*` variables and supplies these account values:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `QA_EMAIL` | Registered email. |
| `QA_ID` | Recorded ID, or empty when unknown. |
| `QA_TAG` | Registration's dispatch tag. |

Other inherited environment variables remain available. For an administrative key, use `AV_<NAME>` and declare the same variable as `env:AV_<NAME>` under `[env.secrets]`. For example, `SERVICE_KEY = "env:AV_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"` enables masking while the helper reads the inherited variable.

That declaration does not inject the key into the helper. Helpers reading secrets another way must never print them, including on failure. Unknown or short values may escape engine-log masking; never paste raw logs into chat.

### Missing cleanup and outcomes

Missing cleanup alone does not stop a valid run. Interactive QA offers a cleanup-only configuration extension. Accounts stay in the application, with the warning below, when there is no proposal, the preview still fails after 1 correction, you decline approval, or the run is headless:

```text
No cleanup recipe: registered accounts will remain in the application.
```

Required configuration gaps and invalid configuration still stop.

The ledger lives at `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/av-marketplace/qa-accounts.json`. The ledger uses the repository's real path and survives runs, repair restarts and private-directory deletion. It stores account identities and cleanup progress, never passwords or tokens.

| Outcome | Meaning / action |
|---|---|
| `deleted` | Cleanup succeeded and QA recorded the outcome. |
| `left` | No usable recipe, invalid/untrusted config, unmatched/unlocked destination, unsafe legacy record or failed attempt below the limit. Review the cause; a later compatible trusted run can retry eligible records. |
| `manual` | The account reached `3` failed attempts during this teardown. Delete it deliberately in the correct application. |

Cleanup uses the current valid, trusted recipe. A SQL endpoint or HTTP origin must match the account's recorded destination and be locked by this run.

Command recipes have no destination and process only accounts recorded without one. Skips for a missing, invalid or untrusted recipe, an unlocked destination or a destination mismatch do not count as failed attempts.

An account recorded with no destination adopts the current recipe's destination on its first attempt. This happens when no recipe, or a command recipe, was configured at registration.

Records from QA 3.1.0 lack the `tag` or `destination` field. They and malformed records stay unchanged, without an attempt, and their emails appear under `left`. For QA 3.1.0 records, delete the account deliberately in the application named by the record's `origin` field. Other eligible records still clean up. Do not edit ledger fields to authorize a different destination.

Each teardown attempts eligible accounts from earlier runs too. QA saves each outcome before attempting the next account. After `3` failures, QA stops automatic retries; `manual` is listed once, not on every later run.

Review account emails in the report and summary. A retained ledger record does not mean cleanup succeeded.

## State Checks

A State Check verifies application state in a configured store. Only backend scenarios support State Checks; frontend State Checks are plan errors.

Use repeatable lines such as `- **State Check:** main: <query> → <expected>`. A store name is optional only when exactly 1 store is configured; with zero or several stores, an unprefixed check is a plan error. An unknown store name is a configuration gap.

Checks use read-only SQL settings or the Redis read-command allowlist. Use a read-only SQL role or restricted Redis ACL for stronger isolation. Missing clients skip only the check, not runnable HTTP assertions.

See [Stores](../../configuration.md#stores) for endpoint keys and [Prerequisites](../qa.md#prerequisites) for clients.

## Examples

These are complete schema examples, not proof that your checkout exposes the illustrated routes. Match ports, commands, models and deletion contracts to repository evidence before approval. Add the [private ignore entries](../../configuration.md#files).

### JWT API: `/register` and `/login`

This assumes registration returns `201 {"id": ...}` and login returns `200 {"token": ...}`. Declare `owner: registered` and `Writes: yes`; testers register, record the account, then capture the login token.

```toml
version = 1

[env.targets]
backend = "http://localhost:8000"

[qa]
fix = "approve"
mutations = "allow"
start_services = "ask"

[qa.cleanup]
kind = "command"
run = "sh scripts/delete-qa-user.sh"
```

The evidenced helper must delete by `QA_EMAIL` and return exit `0`; otherwise choose an evidenced SQL recipe.

### Django session stack: signup, login and cleanup

This assumes signup forms, Django's standard user model and the target server's settings/database. Testers handle CSRF and session cookies themselves.

```toml
version = 1

[env.targets]
ui = "http://localhost:8000"
backend = "http://localhost:8000"

[qa]
fix = "approve"
mutations = "allow"
start_services = "ask"

[qa.cleanup]
kind = "command"
run = '''python3 manage.py shell --verbosity 0 -c '
import os
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

get_user_model().objects.filter(email=os.environ["QA_EMAIL"]).delete()
' '''
```

Use disposable data; custom user models or tenant settings need a repository-specific cleanup command.

### Existing accounts from `.av/secrets.local.env`

Use existing accounts when signup cannot create the required role or state.

```toml
version = 1

[env.targets]
backend = "http://localhost:8000"

[qa]
fix = "approve"
mutations = "deny"
start_services = "ask"

[qa.users.admin]
email = "file:.av/secrets.local.env#QA_ADMIN_EMAIL"
password = "file:.av/secrets.local.env#QA_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
id = "file:.av/secrets.local.env#QA_ADMIN_ID"
description = "Administrator; can inspect every CV"
```

Declare `admin: existing — administrator` under `## Users` and fill the 3 keys privately. Omit the ID source when the plan does not reference it.

### Read-only test/report

Use this for anonymous reads on an already-running app, without stores, users or service lifecycle commands.

```toml
version = 1

[env.targets]
backend = "http://localhost:8000"
ui = "http://localhost:5173"

[qa]
fix = "off"
mutations = "deny"
start_services = "ask"
```

Mark read scenarios `Writes: no`. Static detection still cannot guarantee read-only behavior.

### Supabase local stack

This example uses signup on `:54321` and Postgres on `:54322`, and needs the Supabase CLI and `jq`. Testers use `/auth/v1/signup` on `supabase`, the plan-referenced anon key and registered users `user` and `other`.

```toml
version = 1

[env.targets]
ui = "http://localhost:5173"
backend = "http://localhost:8000"
supabase = "http://127.0.0.1:54321"

[env.services]
health = ["backend:/health", "ui:/"]

[env.values]
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "cmd:supabase status --output json | jq -r .ANON_KEY"

[env.stores.supabase]
kind = "sql"
engine = "postgres"
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 54322
user = "postgres"
name = "postgres"
password = "literal:postgres"

[qa]
fix = "approve"
mutations = "allow"
start_services = "ask"

[qa.cleanup]
kind = "sql"
store = "supabase"
# Application contract: public.cvs.user_id references auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE.
query = "DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = {email}"
```

Verify the cascade migration and any storage deletion separately; repeated State Checks can check ownership using registered IDs.

This example checks an already-running stack. Add only repository-evidenced lifecycle commands for managed startup.
