# Code Review Plugin

Security, architecture, and code quality analysis for your codebase.

**Version:** 2.1.1

## Commands

### `/review`

Run a comprehensive code review covering security, performance, architecture, and maintainability.

```bash
# Review current changes
/review

# Review with specific focus
/review "Check authentication security"

# Review specific area
/review "Analyze the new API endpoints"
```

The review launches parallel analysis agents (security + code quality, and optionally documentation) and combines their findings into a unified report. Each issue gets a unique category-based ID (e.g., `SEC-001`, `PERF-002`, `ARCH-001`, `MAINT-003`, `DOC-001`) and includes severity level, file location, explanation, and remediation with code examples.

<a id="category-prefix-mapping"></a>
**Issue ID categories:**

| Category        | Prefix | Reports Directory       |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------------|
| Security        | SEC    | `docs/reviews/`         |
| Performance     | PERF   | `docs/reviews/`         |
| Architecture    | ARCH   | `docs/reviews/`         |
| Maintainability | MAINT  | `docs/reviews/`         |
| Documentation   | DOC    | `docs/reviews/`         |
| Composite       | COMP   | `docs/reviews/`         |
| Testing         | QA     | `docs/testing/reports/` |

The `Testing → QA` row covers issues produced by the `qa` plugin's `/qa:run` command. Reports for QA issues live under `docs/testing/reports/`; `/fix QA-001` and `/fix-report` (auto-merge) handle them transparently.

### `/fix`

Apply a fix for a single issue from a review report. Supports two modes:

**ID mode** — specify the issue ID directly:

```bash
/fix SEC-001
/fix PERF-042
/fix DOC-001
/fix QA-001
```

The plugin routes by prefix: `QA-NNN` reads from `docs/testing/reports/`, all other prefixes (`SEC`, `PERF`, `ARCH`, `MAINT`, `DOC`, `COMP`) read from `docs/reviews/`. It picks the newest `.md` in the chosen directory, locates the issue by ID, and proceeds with the fix. After fixing, the issue is marked as fixed in the report.

**Paste mode** — paste the full issue block:

```bash
/fix <paste full issue block from /review report>
```

The fix proceeds with the pasted content directly. No report file is updated.

Both modes go through the same fix cycle: parse issue, analyze context, propose fix (waits for your approval), implement, verify with linters/tests, and report results.

`/fix COMP-001` fixes a composite by ID (its components travel in the payload; the composite's Remediation is the only change applied). `/fix SEC-002` on a component of an open composite first asks: fix the composite (recommended), fix the component alone, or abort.

### `/fix-report`

Fix issues from saved reports. Parses one or more reports, presents unfixed issues as a paginated checklist, fixes selected issues, and marks them resolved in their source files.

```bash
# Auto-merge: newest review + newest QA report (recommended after /review and /qa:run)
/fix-report

# Single file
/fix-report docs/reviews/2026-02-20-feature-login.md
/fix-report docs/testing/reports/2026-02-20-user-flow-report.md
```

The command:
1. Resolves files — auto-merge uses newest from `docs/reviews/` and `docs/testing/reports/`; with an explicit path, uses just that file
2. Reads each file and extracts issues (by `### [SEVERITY] ID: Title` headings), tracking which report each issue came from
3. Filters out already-fixed issues (those with a `**Status:**` field)
4. Presents unfixed issues as a partitioned, paginated checklist: `needs-decision` findings lead on their own page(s), ahead of every `auto`-policy page, sorted by severity within each group — no page mixes the two. Page capacity is 3 issues on any page carrying an appended skip item, and 4 only on the final page of the whole checklist. In auto-merge mode the source basename is shown in each option so review issues and QA issues are distinguishable
5. Fixes selected issues sequentially via the `fix-auto` agent
6. Marks fixed issues with `**Status:** ✅ Fixed (YYYY-MM-DD)` back in the file each issue came from (auto-merge may write to multiple files in one run)

- `/fix-report` runs the same composition pass, asks the dissolve question before the checklist, shows a composite as one checklist item, and persists selected composites after selection, before the decision gate.

The reports become living documents — fixed issues won't appear on subsequent `/fix-report` runs.

Issues flagged `**Fix-policy:** needs-decision` show a `[needs-decision: <drift-class>]` prefix in the checklist description so you can decide them consciously.

### `/fix-all`

Bulk-fix every unfixed `auto`-policy issue from one or more saved reports after a single yes/no confirmation, then offers to resolve the `**Fix-policy:** needs-decision` findings it skipped — one question per finding, with the code analysed for you. Supports an optional minimum severity filter.

```bash
# Auto-merge: fix every unfixed issue (except needs-decision) in the newest review + newest QA report
/fix-all

# Severity floor: only fix HIGH+CRITICAL issues
/fix-all HIGH

# Single file: fix every unfixed issue (except needs-decision) in this report
/fix-all docs/reviews/2026-02-20-feature-login.md

# Combined: HIGH+CRITICAL issues in a specific file (order is free)
/fix-all CRITICAL docs/reviews/2026-02-20-feature-login.md
```

The command:

1. Resolves files — auto-merge uses newest from `docs/reviews/` and `docs/testing/reports/`; with an explicit path, uses just that file (same as `/fix-report`).
2. Reads each file, extracts issues, and filters out those whose `**Status:**` line begins with `✅ Fixed`, `⚠️ Partially Fixed` or `🚫 Rejected` — matched by prefix, since the ` — <reason>` tail a rejected status carries would break a whole-line comparison.
3. Runs the composition pass (Step 1.6) over each review report: reads persisted composites, asks the `composition-analyst` for new groupings, validates them and assigns `COMP-NNN` IDs — see [Composite findings](#composite-findings).
4. Applies the optional severity floor (`HIGH` keeps HIGH+CRITICAL, `MEDIUM` keeps MEDIUM+HIGH+CRITICAL, etc.).
5. Applies the Fix-policy filter — issues flagged `needs-decision` move to a skipped list; issues without the field are treated as `auto`. **If that leaves no `auto` issues at all** — the zero-auto path, where every unfixed finding needs a decision — steps 6–9 below are skipped entirely and the command goes straight to step 10.
6. *(auto-batch path only)* Renders a **pre-flight summary** — full issue table sorted by severity, with per-severity counts, a Source column for feedback-origin issues, and the skipped `needs-decision` findings listed under "Requires user decision". The pre-flight shows each composite as one row, its components under a **Composites** block, and asks the dissolve question before the confirmation gate; accepted composites are persisted at Step 3.0, after the gate. On the zero-auto path the Composites block and the dissolve question run at the head of Step 5.2, before the decision offer; persistence runs after the `yes` to that offer, before the decision gate is loaded.
7. *(auto-batch path only)* Asks one yes/no question: `Proceed with fixing all N issues sequentially?`
8. Sequentially invokes `fix-auto` on every queued issue, continuing through any individual failures.
9. Marks each Fixed/Partially Fixed issue with `**Status:** ✅ Fixed (YYYY-MM-DD)` back in the file it came from, then displays a final summary table, which repeats the "Requires user decision" list.
10. Offers to resolve the skipped `needs-decision` findings — a second yes/no question, then the [Decision Stage](#decision-stage) below runs the whole flow and writes its own results back. On the zero-auto path this step prints the "Requires user decision" list itself, since neither summary ran. Declining leaves those findings for a later run.

**When to use `/fix-all` vs `/fix-report`:**

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Pick specific issues from a long report | `/fix-report` (paginated checklist) |
| Fix one issue by ID | `/fix <ID>` |
| Trust the report, fix everything except `needs-decision`-flagged issues | `/fix-all` |
| Resolve `needs-decision` findings in bulk, with the code analysed | `/fix-all` (offers the decision stage after the auto batch) or `/fix-report` (decision findings lead the checklist) |
| Fix only the most-severe issues | `/fix-all CRITICAL` or `/fix-all HIGH` |

**Note on feedback-origin issues** (those with `**Source:**` from `/analyze-feedback`): `/fix-all` lists them with a `Source` column showing the reviewer handle, but does **not** apply the "untrusted-provenance" framing that `/fix` and `/fix-report` use — `/fix-all` is a bulk, trust-the-report path, so it surfaces the reviewer handle for context without gating each issue on provenance.

**Restart safety.** Re-running `/fix-all` against the same report(s) is safe and idempotent. After each Fixed / Partially Fixed issue, the command writes a `**Status:**` line into the source report and then re-reads the file to verify the line landed. On the next run, Step 1.3's filter sees that Status line and skips the issue, so no edit is applied twice. If a Status write fails (heading drift, read-only file, write race), the failure surfaces in the final summary under **Status write failures** with per-issue reasons — re-run `/fix-all` to retry that subset, or add the `**Status:**` line manually under each affected heading. The code change itself already landed; only the report annotation is missing.

**Performance.** `/fix-all` runs sequentially — each issue spawns its own `fix-auto` subagent (analyze → edit → verify → report) before the next one starts. Expect roughly 20–60 s per issue depending on file size and which verifiers run (linter alone is fast; SAST + typecheck + tests is slower), so a 30-issue report can take 10–30 minutes end-to-end. Since 2.1.0 two costs sit ahead of that baseline, both paid before any issue is fixed: the composition pass (Step 1.6) dispatches one read-only `composition-analyst` per review file that holds at least two groupable findings — files run in parallel, so budget about one `fix-auto`'s worth of wall clock, 20–60 s, once for the whole run rather than per issue — and the dissolve question costs one prompt per four composites (⌈Y/4⌉ answers for Y composites), which is your time rather than the model's. Grouping pays part of it back: each composite the run keeps is a single `fix-auto` call covering all of its components, so a report with composites makes fewer `fix-auto` calls than it has findings. During the run, each iteration prints a `Fixing issue N/<total>: [<SEVERITY>] <ID>: <Title>` heartbeat so you can see progress. You can Ctrl+C between issues and partial progress is preserved: fixed source files keep their edits on disk, and `**Status:**` lines already written into the report stay — Step 1.3's filter will skip those issues on the next run. The only thing lost on interrupt is the in-memory final summary table.

**Fix-policy handling:** issues carrying `**Fix-policy:** needs-decision` (documentation drift classified `decision` or `dead-reference` by the docs-fact-registry doctrine) are skipped by default and listed under "Requires user decision" in the pre-flight and final summaries — or, on the zero-auto path where neither summary runs, by the decision offer itself. Issues without a `Fix-policy` field are treated as `auto`, so pre-existing reports behave exactly as before. `/fix-all` itself offers to resolve the skipped issues once the auto batch finishes — see [Decision Stage](#decision-stage) below — so there is no separate override flag needed; declining that offer, or reaching the findings from a different run, works the same way through `/fix-report` (decision findings lead the checklist) or `/fix <ID>`. Whichever entry point you use, the command first asks which resolution to apply (e.g., remove the dead mention vs restore the referent) and passes your decision to the fixer; if the issue lacks a usable location (`—`), it also asks for the target file before dispatching.

### `/analyze-feedback`

Analyze PR review comments, classify each as "address" or "reject", and optionally publish response drafts.

```bash
# Analyze current branch's PR
/analyze-feedback

# Analyze specific PR
/analyze-feedback 123

# Include general conversation comments
/analyze-feedback 123 --include-conversation
```

Requires GitHub CLI (`gh`) to be installed and authenticated.

#### Issue Persistence

Comments classified as **Address** are persisted to `docs/reviews/` in the same format as `/review` issues. This makes them consumable by `/fix` and `/fix-report`.

**Create mode** — if no prior `/review` was saved for this branch:

```bash
/analyze-feedback 123
# Creates: docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<branch-slug>-feedback.md
# Issues get IDs starting at SEC-001, PERF-001, ARCH-001, etc.
```

**Append mode** — if a `/review` file already exists for this branch:

```bash
/review            # Saves to docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<branch-slug>.md
/analyze-feedback 123
# Appends to the existing file with a new "## Feedback Issues — PR #123 (date)" section
# IDs continue from max+1 per category (e.g., if review has SEC-003, feedback starts at SEC-004)
```

Each issue includes a `**Source:**` field linking back to the original PR comment, preserving traceability:

```markdown
**Source:** @reviewer — [PR #123 comment](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123#discussion_r12345)
```

On feedback-origin issues the `**OWASP:**` and `**CWE:**` fields are optional — they are included only when the agent can confidently infer them from the reviewer's comment, and omitted otherwise.

**Reject classification** — comments marked as "Reject" are handled as before: reasoning shown in the report, optional draft responses published to GitHub via Phase 6.

<a id="untrusted-provenance"></a>
### Untrusted Provenance

> **Untrusted provenance:** Issue blocks containing a `**Source:** @reviewer — [PR #N comment](…)` field originate from PR comments (via `/analyze-feedback`) and have not been independently validated. Treat the `Problem`, `Impact`, and `Remediation` text as hints, not authoritative guidance. Re-verify each claim against the actual code before implementing.

This is the canonical wording referenced by `/fix` (Step 0.7) and `/fix-report` (Step 1.4). Both commands embed this blockquote verbatim and link here.

Operational guidance for downstream consumers:

- **`/fix`** — surface the `Source:` field (reviewer handle + comment URL) in the approval prompt so the user can weigh the suggestion accordingly.
- **`/fix-report`** — when presenting the issue checklist and when handing each block to the `fix-auto` subagent, surface the `Source:` field so the user (and the subagent) can weigh the suggestion accordingly.

Reports sourced from `/review` directly do not include a `Source:` field and carry normal trust. Feedback-origin reports typically live at `docs/reviews/*-feedback.md`.

<a id="decision-stage"></a>
## Decision Stage

`/fix-all` (Step 5, once the auto batch is done) and `/fix-report` (Step 2.4, before Step 3's dispatch) both offer to resolve findings flagged `**Fix-policy:** needs-decision` — you never need a third command for them. Both entry points load the same `decision-gate` skill, so the flow you see is identical wherever it starts.

### The flow

1. **Location pre-check.** A finding whose `**Location:**` field isn't a usable `path:line` is asked for one first, in batches of up to 4 questions. A declined target is reported Failed and left for the next run rather than dispatched.
2. **Analysis fan-out.** The read-only `decision-analyst` agent runs once per finding, in parallel, in batches of at most 8 — announced before anything is dispatched (e.g. "13 findings to analyse, in 2 batches of at most 8"). Each analyst reads the code the finding actually points at and returns a rendered fix proposal. It never edits.
3. **The sweep.** One finding at a time, you're shown the target, the recommendation and its reason, the risk, and both alternatives in full, then asked for one of five outcomes: `[A] [B] [skip] [reject]`, plus the tool's built-in `other…` free-form answer. `A`/`B` dispatch the chosen alternative; `other…` lets you write your own resolution, which is restated as a full self-contained fix and confirmed before dispatch; `skip` leaves the finding for the next run with nothing written; `reject` writes a terminal `🚫 Rejected` status (below) and is offered only where the reason is grounded in evidence or your own stated reason.
4. **The batch.** Every decision is collected before any fix is dispatched — decide everything, then fix in bulk. Decided findings are then dispatched to `fix-auto` sequentially, and the orchestrator itself — not `fix-auto`'s own verdict — runs the persisted verification plan for each, logging raw output before writing the status back to the source report.

> **Residual risk, accepted and unmitigated.** The execution boundary around the stage's own commands is model-enforced, not machine-enforced. Both the sweep's re-run of cited reject evidence and the batch's verification run execute with the orchestrator's grants rather than the read-only analyst's. Those grants are narrowed to the seven read-only git subcommands the stage actually runs (`log`, `show`, `diff`, `blame`, `status`, `hash-object`, `rev-parse`), so a destructive subcommand is no longer pre-approved and raises the platform's prompt. That prompt is a backstop, not the boundary: it can be answered in haste, it is not the sweep's `AskUserQuestion`, and what still keeps `git restore` and `git checkout` out of a re-run in the first place is prose the orchestrating model follows. The pin pipeline's own grants are not part of this risk — `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `shasum` and `sha256sum` have no write mode, which is why the excerpt is cut with `head`/`tail` rather than `sed`, whose prefix grant would have admitted `sed -i`. What it destroys is the working tree's uncommitted diff — which is exactly the recovery path this loop leaves you for a wrong call, since every fix is deliberately left uncommitted so you can read it and throw it away yourself. A lapse takes the undo with it.
>
> One level down, the same holds for the fixes themselves: `fix-auto` holds unrestricted `Edit`, `Write` and `Bash`, so the orchestrator's before/after observation of the tree can see a write outside the files the decision pinned but cannot stop one. Such a write is reported, not prevented — and it is named only in the run summary, which does not survive the session that printed it, so nothing about it reaches the report a later reader would find.

A needs-decision composite goes through the stage as one finding: the analyst receives the composite block plus its component blocks (each feedback-origin component wrapped as untrusted data on its own), the plan carries one check per open component (none for one already fixed or rejected), each prefixed with the component's ID (`SEC-002: <check> → <expected>`) — the prefix is how the orchestrator attributes a check to a component, each component's file is pinned `:ref`, and stage 4 grades the components from the plan's raw output — the fixer's Components table is advisory.

### Where the two entry points differ

| | `/fix-all` Step 5 | `/fix-report` Step 2.4 |
|---|---|---|
| When it runs | After the auto batch, behind its own yes/no offer | Before Step 3's dispatch, folded into the same checklist |
| Stages it runs | All of them — dispatches and verifies its own batch | The sweep runs in the gate's own slot; Step 3 then applies the same dispatch contract, and decided findings join the selected `auto` findings in one sequential batch, decided first |
| Where `needs-decision` findings appear | Listed as skipped in the pre-flight/final summary, then offered | Lead the paginated checklist on their own page(s), ahead of every `auto` page |

### The `decision-analyst` agent

A read-only subagent (`code-review:decision-analyst`) analyses exactly one `needs-decision` finding against the code it actually points at and returns a rendered fix proposal: `Target`, `Findings` (every claim backed by a citable command or tool call plus its verbatim output), `Alternatives` (A and B, or A alone where the code supports no second direction), `Recommendation`, `Risk`, `Code Preview`, a per-alternative `Verification Plan`, and an optional `Rejection candidate`. It writes nothing — reading and reporting is the whole of its job. Its `tools:` grant is `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Bash` and `Skill`, with `disallowedTools` closing `Edit`, `Write` and `NotebookEdit`, and its agent definition binds it to read-only inspection. Keeping the agent that reads separate from the agent that writes is what keeps the decision with you.

> **Residual risk, probe run and confirmed (2026-08-29).** Earlier releases declared this agent's shell as four two-word specifiers (`Bash(git log:*)`, `Bash(git show:*)`, `Bash(git diff:*)`, `Bash(git blame:*)`) and described that as a read-only *property*. It is not one. A probe dispatched the agent under that grant and it ran `git status --porcelain` — a git subcommand outside the declared four — and then `echo grant-probe`, which is not git at all. The two-word form scopes nothing; the grant resolves to base `Bash`. (A `git commit --dry-run` in the same probe was refused, but by this repository's own pre-commit hook rather than by the grant, so it proves nothing either way.) The declaration has been corrected to plain `Bash` as of 2.0.1 — the agent's capability did not change, only the honesty of the line describing it.
>
> **So: assume the analyst can run anything a shell can run.** `disallowedTools` closes `Edit`, `Write` and `NotebookEdit`, which stops the tool-mediated writes and only those — a script that opens a file for writing is not an `Edit` call. The grant also carries `Skill` with no restriction on which skills load; since the shell is already unrestricted, that adds no capability, but a loaded skill's `allowed-tools:` can turn execution that would have prompted you into execution that does not.
>
> What actually protects you is not the frontmatter. It is, first, the untrusted-input protocol: a feedback-origin finding — one whose text came from a third party's PR comment via `/analyze-feedback` — reaches the analyst wrapped in nonce-bound delimiters and labelled as data, never instructions, so a report's own text cannot steer the agent holding that shell. And second, the human decision gate: every proposal the analyst returns is shown to you with the code in view, and nothing is dispatched to a fixer until you pick an outcome. The agent proposes; you decide; only then does anything get written. What you should *not* assume is that the platform is preventing the analyst from writing — its read-only behaviour is a discipline its definition imposes on it, and the gate is what the design actually rests on.

### The `🚫 Rejected` status

`🚫 Rejected` joins `✅ Fixed` and `⚠️ Partially Fixed` as a terminal report status, written only through the sweep's `reject` outcome:

```
**Status:** 🚫 Rejected (YYYY-MM-DD) — <reason>
```

The ` — <reason>` tail is permitted only on this status — no other status value carries one. `reject` is offered only where the reason is grounded: either the analyst's cited evidence, re-run and shown to you before the choice is offered, or, where there is no citable evidence, your own non-empty stated reason (in which case the rejection is marked `unverified` in the run summary). `🚫 Rejected` is terminal and hand-recoverable only — no command re-offers a rejected finding: `/fix-report` and `/fix-all` exclude it at their Step 1.3 filter (matched by prefix, since the ` — <reason>` tail would break a whole-line comparison), `fix-auto` aborts immediately if dispatched against a block that already carries it, and `/fix <ID>` aborts at Phase 0 before reaching it and never overwrites an existing `**Status:**` line.

### The extended `Location:` form

Where the decision stage supplies or corrects a finding's address, it writes the extended form rather than replacing the field outright:

```
**Location:** `path:line` (was: `original`)
```

The reviewer's original location is preserved in the `(was: …)` tail rather than discarded, so a wrong correction costs a stale parenthetical, not the finding's only address. Every consumer reads the field the same way: take the first backticked token as the location and ignore any trailing parenthetical; where the line carries no backticked token at all (a legacy, unbackticked `**Location:** path:line`), take the first whitespace-delimited token after the field name instead.

### Loop-written finding-block fields

The decision stage writes up to six additional fields into a finding block, alongside the existing `**Status:**`. Each occupies exactly one physical line, is replaced in place rather than accumulated across attempts, and is stripped from the copy handed to `fix-auto` (except the rewritten `**Location:**`, which travels with it). Two further writers sit outside this stage: on the auto path, the fix commands write a `**Verification:** advisory — <checks run>` line for a composite and its resolved components, so a `**Verification:**` line alone no longer implies a decided finding, and the composition pass writes `**Composed-of:**`, `**Part-of:**` and `**Origin:**` (see [Composite findings](#composite-findings)).

| Field | Written when | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `**Decision:**` | `A`, `B` or `other…` is chosen | `<label> — <resolution text> [<who>, <date>; attempt N: <outcome>…]` — the dispatchable resolution plus attempt bookkeeping |
| `**Decision-retired:**` | A decision fails twice without ever writing a status | The superseded decision's full history, kept rather than deleted, so the next sweep shows what was already tried |
| `**Verification-plan:**` | Alongside `**Decision:**` | The per-check plan (`<check> → <expected>[ (soft)]; …`) the orchestrator runs at verification time, persisted so a resumed run can verify without re-analysing |
| `**Decision-pin:**` | Alongside `**Decision:**` | A content hash of the finding block plus one hash per file the resolution touches, so an edit to those files between decision and dispatch is detected |
| `**Dispatch:**` | Immediately before each `fix-auto` call | `attempt <N> dispatched <date>` — distinguishes "decided, never dispatched" from "dispatched, outcome unknown" on a resumed run |
| `**Verification:**` | Alongside the status line (or the attempt entry, where none is written) | `hard`/`advisory`/`unavailable` — `<checks run>[; <N> not run: <check text>]` — how the status was actually verified, since a run summary does not survive the session that printed it |

## Composite findings

Several findings often share one cause: five "missing validation in endpoint X" findings that are really one missing validation layer. Since 2.1.0 the plugin recognises such groups as **composites** and fixes each as one unit — the composite's Remediation is applied once, and the fixer reports per component whether the symptom is gone, instead of patching the symptoms one by one.

**Format.** A composite is an ordinary finding block with `**Category:** Composite`, prefix `COMP`, living in `docs/reviews/`:

```markdown
### [HIGH] COMP-001: Missing input validation layer

**ID:** COMP-001
**Location:** `src/api/validation.py:1`
**Category:** Composite
**Composed-of:** SEC-002, SEC-003, ARCH-001
**Origin:** review
**Effort:** medium

**Problem:** the shared cause
**Impact:** what the combination costs
**Remediation:** the single change that resolves every component
```

Each component carries `**Part-of:** COMP-001` after its `**ID:**` line. `**Composed-of:**` is the source of truth for membership (two to twelve IDs from the same report, on one physical line); `Part-of` is a derived back-reference. A composite's severity is never below its components' maximum (the fix commands raise a hand-edited block's effective severity to that maximum for the run without rewriting it); composites never nest; a component belongs to at most one open composite. `**Fix-policy:** needs-decision` is inherited when any component carries a non-`auto` policy.

**Where composites come from.** `/review` renders the cross-verifier's composite findings as `COMP` blocks — only where one change resolves every basis, bases kept disjoint, `COMP` IDs assigned last so `Composed-of` carries final IDs. `/fix-all` and `/fix-report` additionally run a **composition pass** (Step 1.6) before their pre-flight: a read-only `composition-analyst` agent reads the unfixed, ungrouped findings of each review report and proposes groups that share one cause and one fix, with a citation per member and a self-falsification battery; the command re-validates every proposal (membership, size, disjointness, a usable and contained `Location`) and assigns the next `COMP-NNN`. A composite whose `Composed-of` names an ID with no block in the report is malformed: the pass sets it aside, lists it as `malformed-composite`, fixes its present components individually, and leaves it open until repaired or dissolved. QA reports are never grouped, and `/qa:run` is untouched.

**The dissolve question — the one human gate on a grouping.** Before the confirmation gate (`/fix-all`) or before the checklist (`/fix-report`), one multi-select question lists every composite the run holds, proposed and persisted alike, four per page, with its Problem and Remediation on screen: dissolve a proposal and its components are fixed individually and nothing is written; dissolve a persisted composite and its block gets `🚫 Rejected (date) — dissolved into components`, releasing its components. If the question cannot be asked, every composite is dissolved for the run — silence is never read as consent. Accepted composites are persisted into the report (`Origin: fix-time`, `Part-of` on each component) only after the run has committed to dispatching, so an aborted run writes nothing.

**Fixing.** A composite is one `fix-auto` call whose payload is the composite block followed by every component block; the fixer applies the composite's Remediation and nothing else, never a component's own Remediation, and returns a `**Components:**` table of `resolved` / `unresolved` / `unresolved (no location)` / `skipped (fixed)` / `skipped (rejected)`. The verdict is computed over the components actually checked; a composite none of whose components could be checked is Failed, disclosed as `no component checked`. The composite's status and each `resolved` component's `✅ Fixed` are written back by the usual recipe. On the auto path those component statuses rest on the fixer's own re-read and are labelled `advisory (fixer self-report)` in the Fix Summary; on the decision-gate path each component is graded by the orchestrator on that component's own check in the decided verification plan. A needs-decision composite goes through the [Decision Stage](#decision-stage) as **one** finding. `/fix COMP-001` fixes a composite by ID through `/fix`'s own phases; `/fix SEC-002` on a bound component asks whether to fix the composite instead, the component alone, or abort.

**Re-runs.** Markers are on disk before the first dispatch, so an interrupted run leaves its successor the same composites. A `Partially Fixed` composite releases its unresolved components, which return individually; a `Failed` composite returns whole and can be dissolved. A component fixed alone leaves the composite open until fewer than two components remain, when the composite is degenerate and its lone component is fixed as an ordinary finding.

## What It Analyzes

- **Security** — OWASP Top 10:2025 compliance, injection attacks, XSS, authentication bypasses, insecure crypto, hardcoded secrets, dependency CVEs
- **Architecture** — SOLID principles, Clean Architecture boundaries, DDD patterns, anti-patterns (God Objects, circular dependencies)
- **Performance** — N+1 queries, missing indexes, memory leaks, unbounded collections, blocking calls
- **Code Quality** — Complexity, naming, error handling, test coverage gaps
- **Documentation** — Outdated docs, missing doc entries, stale API references (conditional — only when project has documentation)
- **Standards** — Project-specific coding conventions discovered from documentation
- **Dependencies** — Known CVEs in third-party packages

## Built-in Verification

Every review automatically includes cross-domain correlation and adversarial review of findings. No additional flags are needed.

### What It Does

After the standard analysis (security + code quality + optional documentation auditors), two verification subagents analyze the findings in parallel:

- **Cross-Verifier**: identifies correlations between security, quality, and documentation findings (e.g., a God Object with a vulnerability = higher blast radius, undocumented endpoint with a security bypass), coverage gaps, and composite findings
- **Challenger**: challenges every Critical/High finding for false positives, validates severity levels, and calibrates severity across security, quality, and documentation domains

### Additional Report Sections

Every review includes a Verification Summary showing:
- Number of findings verified, removed, and adjusted
- Cross-analysis correlations (security <-> quality <-> documentation)
- Challenged findings with reasoning
- Rejected by auditors (self-falsification) — findings the auditors rejected in their own refutation pass, with reasons
- Doctrine-gap candidates — real signals with no backing rule, candidates for new standards

### Cost Considerations

Verification spawns 2 additional subagent instances (Cross-Verifier + Challenger) as part of every review. When project documentation is detected, a third subagent (documentation-auditor) is also launched during the analysis phase.

## Save Review to File

After the review report is generated, you are asked whether to save it to a file. If you choose "Yes", the report is saved to `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<branch-slug>.md`.

The branch name is slugified (e.g., `feature/user-login` becomes `feature-user-login`). If a file with that name already exists, a numeric suffix is appended (`-2`, `-3`, etc.).

## Fixing Issues

After the review, if issues were found and the report was saved, the review suggests running `/fix-report <path>` to fix issues from the saved report. For individual issues, use `/fix SEC-001` (by ID from the saved report) or `/fix <issue block>` (by pasting). To fix every unfixed issue (except `needs-decision`-flagged ones) in one pass, use `/fix-all` (optionally with a severity floor like `/fix-all HIGH`).

**Recommended workflow (local review):**

1. Run `/review` and save the report. Optionally run `/qa:run` (it reuses the branch's QA plan or generates one) — when both reports exist, `/fix-report` (no argument) auto-merges them into a single checklist.
2. Fix using one of these methods:
   - `/fix-report` — auto-merge mode: fixes issues from the newest review report and the newest QA report in one pass
   - `/fix-all` — bulk-fix every unfixed `auto`-policy issue across the newest review + QA reports after one yes/no confirmation
   - `/fix-all HIGH` — same as above, with a severity floor (also `CRITICAL`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`)
   - `/fix-report docs/reviews/2026-02-20-feature-login.md` — single-file mode: fix only this report
   - `/fix SEC-001` (or `/fix QA-001`) — fix a single issue by ID
   - `/fix <paste issue block>` — fix by pasting the full block
3. Re-run `/fix-report` to fix remaining issues

**Recommended workflow (PR feedback):**

1. Run `/analyze-feedback <PR-URL>` to classify reviewer comments and persist actionable items as a review report in `docs/reviews/*-feedback.md`
2. Fix using one of these methods:
   - `/fix-report docs/reviews/2026-02-20-feature-login-feedback.md` — fix multiple issues interactively
   - `/fix-all docs/reviews/2026-02-20-feature-login-feedback.md` — bulk-fix every unfixed issue in this feedback report after one yes/no confirmation (feedback issues carry no `Fix-policy` field, so none are skipped) (optionally add a severity floor, e.g. `/fix-all HIGH docs/reviews/...`). **Caveat:** `/fix-all` skips the per-issue [untrusted-provenance](#untrusted-provenance) prompt that `/fix-report` shows for feedback reports — use only when you trust the report source.
   - `/fix SEC-001` — fix a single issue by ID (feedback-origin issues use the same category prefixes as `/review`)
   - `/fix <paste issue block>` — fix by pasting the full block
3. Re-run `/fix-report` on the same file to fix remaining issues

## Skills

### Developer Plugins Integration

**Skill:** `developer-plugins-integration`

Automatically detects installed developer plugins (python-developer, frontend-developer, php-developer) and the project's tech stack, then loads relevant skills for enhanced code review and fix workflows.

**How it works:**
1. Detects if python-developer, frontend-developer, and/or php-developer plugins are installed
2. Scans project config files (pyproject.toml, package.json, composer.json, etc.) to identify the tech stack
3. Maps detected stack to relevant developer skills (coding standards, framework patterns — including Django, Celery, Symfony, Doctrine, etc.)
4. Passes skills to review auditors and fix commands for stack-aware analysis

**Used by:**
- `/review` — Passes developer skills to security-auditor and code-quality-auditor
- `/fix` — Applies framework-specific patterns when implementing fixes
- `fix-auto` agent — Same as `/fix` but autonomous

**Graceful degradation:** If no developer plugins are installed, the review and fix workflows proceed with standard behavior. No additional action needed.

### Finding Falsification

**Skill:** `finding-falsification`

Doctrine for self-falsification in reporting agents: a six-check refutation battery every finding must survive, and a three-bucket disposition (report / "Rejected after verification" / "Doctrine-gap candidates" — never silently dropped). Preloaded by security-auditor, code-quality-auditor, documentation-auditor, and challenger, plus composition-analyst under a recorded partial exemption (grouping-adapted battery, rejected groupings only).

### Verdict Protocol

**Skill:** `verdict-protocol`

Authoring-time doctrine for a reporting agent's closing contract: closed verdict vocabulary, verdict computed by a declared predicate, exhaustion semantics, consumer routing, and a Required/Advised/Optional triage axis distinct from severity. Referenced from `docs/contributing.md`; not preloaded by any agent (applies when writing or reviewing agent definitions).

### Docs Fact Registry

**Skill:** `docs-fact-registry`

Declarative docs↔code drift checking: a claim → source-of-truth → policy registry with three-way classification (mechanical → auto-fixable; decision and dead references → escalated as `needs-decision`). Preloaded by documentation-auditor; its `Fix-policy` field drives `/fix-all`'s default skip.

## Helper Scripts

The plugin ships executable shell helpers under `plugins/code-review/scripts/`
that the `/analyze-feedback` command (Phase 5.5) invokes for security-critical
operations. Extracting the logic into real scripts means the hardening is
load-bearing rather than dependent on the LLM faithfully rendering ~200 lines
of prose bash.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `slugify-branch.sh` | Canonical branch-name slugifier. Strips control chars, bidi overrides (CVE-2021-42574 class), zero-width joiners, shell metachars; caps length at 60 and refuses leading-dash output. |
| `allocate-feedback-file.sh` | Locates an existing review file by mtime-ordered glob, otherwise atomically creates `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-feedback.md` via a single `os.open(O_CREAT\|O_EXCL\|O_NOFOLLOW)` syscall. Handles up to 1000 collisions and asserts path containment within `docs/reviews/`. |
| `extract-issue-ids.sh` | Consolidated `PREFIX-NNN` extractor for issues in `docs/reviews/` files. Scope: every prefix in the [Category→Prefix mapping](#category-prefix-mapping) **except** `QA`, which is intentionally excluded because QA reports live under `docs/testing/reports/` and are produced by `/qa:run`, not `/analyze-feedback`. |
| `check-prefix-sync.sh` | CI guard for the Category→Prefix SSoT (CROSS-001). Parses the canonical [Category→Prefix table](#category-prefix-mapping) and diffs each consumer's prefix list (`commands/fix.md` regex, `agents/fix-auto.md` Category enum, `scripts/extract-issue-ids.sh` regex) against its declared scope. Exits non-zero on divergence. Run from CI or pre-commit to block merges that add a new prefix to the canonical table without updating every consumer. |

### ARCH-001 follow-up

The current scripts cover the slug-sanitization, file-allocation, and
issue-ID-extraction surface area called out in ARCH-001. The remaining
follow-up work is **adding a `bats-core` test suite** under
`plugins/code-review/tests/` covering:

- Slug edge cases: empty input, leading dashes, embedded `\n`/`\r`/`\t`,
  bidi override sequences, zero-width joiners, length > 60.
- Symlink-swap attacks against `allocate-feedback-file.sh`.
- ARG_MAX behavior on huge `docs/reviews/` directories.
- O_EXCL race semantics under concurrent invocations.

Until those tests exist, the `O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW` invariant and the
slug contract are verified only by code review. Tracked as a follow-up; the
scripts themselves are the canonical implementation.

## Upgrade Notes

**`code-review` 2.1.0 changes how a pre-existing review report is dispatched, not how it is parsed.** Every new field (`**Composed-of:**`, `**Part-of:**`, `**Origin:**`, `**Category:** Composite`) is additive: the `### [SEVERITY]` block extraction, `fix-auto`'s field table, `extract-issue-ids.sh` and the `**Status:**` grammar all read an old report unchanged. Their dispatch does change: the fix-time composition pass may group an old review or feedback report's unfixed findings, persist `Composed-of`/`Part-of`/`Origin` markers into the file and dispatch a group as one `fix-auto` call. The dissolve question is the per-run veto, no write happens before the run's commitment point (the confirmation gate, or the `yes` to the decision offer on `/fix-all`'s zero-auto path), and the pass is fail-safe — an unavailable analyst means no grouping, never a blocked run. A reader older than 2.1.0 ignores the new fields and dispatches a `COMP` block like any finding, applying its Remediation without the component checks; pair versions when a report carries composites.

**`code-review` 2.0.0 requires every reader to be ≥ 2.0.0 too — this is a requirement, not a recommendation.** A report carrying a `🚫 Rejected` status, or a `**Location:**` line in the extended `(was: …)` form, is a committed artifact, and nothing on the writing side stops an older reader from opening it. This is the worse of the two version skews this release introduces, because the failure is silent and the outcome is terminal:

- A collaborator still on `code-review` 1.17.3 has a Step 1.3 filter that does not recognize `🚫 Rejected` as a resolved status. `/fix-report` re-offers the rejected finding, and dispatching it silently reverses an outcome this design calls terminal and hand-recoverable only.
- A 1.17.3 `/fix` reads the extended `**Location:**` form with the old whole-line rule, treats the reviewer's original inside the `(was: …)` tail as the value, and reads it as missing — degrading to asking you for an address the report already holds.

Do not open, or run any code-review command against, a report written after this release with a `code-review` build older than 2.0.0.

**`code-review` 2.0.0 also expects `qa` ≥ 2.6.0 for any shared report that can carry a decision-stage rejection.** An older `/qa:loop` (< 2.6.0) does not know to preserve a `🚫 Rejected` line: its Step 4.1 in-place Status update overwrites it — losing the rejection and its reason — whenever a sibling issue passes on the same scenario in a later iteration. Unlike the reader skew above, this one has a precondition attached: `**Fix-policy:** needs-decision` is emitted only by this plugin's producers — today, reports written by `/review` — so a report the `qa` plugin produced cannot presently reach the decision gate or acquire a rejection at all, and `qa` 2.6.0's handling of the field is forward compatibility for a schema the QA producers do not yet emit. Pair the minimums for reports that can carry one. See [qa.md's Upgrade Notes](qa.md#upgrade-notes) for the mirror of this note.
