# extract-issue-ids.sh — consolidated PREFIX-NNN extractor for review files.
#
# Reads a review markdown file and emits, on stdout, one canonical issue ID
# per line (e.g., `SEC-003`, `PERF-002`, `ARCH-001`, `MAINT-014`, `DOC-007`).
#
# Scope: only prefixes whose reports live in docs/reviews/ (SEC, PERF, ARCH,
# MAINT, DOC, COMP). The QA prefix is intentionally excluded — QA reports
# live in docs/testing/reports/ and are produced by /qa:run, not
# /analyze-feedback, so this script never encounters QA-NNN IDs.
#
# SSoT for review-directory prefixes: docs/plugins/code-review.md#category-prefix-mapping
# — when adding a new prefix that produces reports under docs/reviews/, update
# both the canonical mapping AND this script's regex.
#
# Usage:
#   bash plugins/code-review/scripts/extract-issue-ids.sh <review-file>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — file scanned, IDs (if any) emitted on stdout.
#   1 — file does not exist or is not readable.
#   2 — usage error (missing argument).
