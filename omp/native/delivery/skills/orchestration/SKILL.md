# Delivery orchestration

Procedures of the delivery plugin. The delivery extension starts the **Delivery run** when a plan with `### Task` headings is approved in plan mode; `/delivery:execute` starts it for a plan file. The Delivery run uses the other sections. Values in `<ANGLE_BRACKETS>` come from the caller.

## Delivery run

Inputs: `PLAN_SOURCE` — the plan as the caller gave it: a `local://` URL or a file path; `PLAN_FILE` — the plan's absolute file path, when the caller knows it.

Run the steps in order. Every `stop` prints its message and ends the run.

### 1. Preflight

1. Run **Plugin roots**. Keep the `code-review` root.
2. `REPO=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`. A failure → stop with `Delivery needs a git repository.` Step 3 resolves paths from the session's working directory. Run every command after step 3 from `$REPO`.
3. **Plan file.**
   - `PLAN_FILE` given → keep it.
   - `PLAN_SOURCE` is a `local://` URL and no `PLAN_FILE` is given → leave `PLAN_FILE` unset.
   - Otherwise `PLAN_FILE=$(realpath "$PLAN_SOURCE")`; a failure → stop with `Plan not found: <PLAN_SOURCE>.`
   - `PLAN_FILE` inside `$REPO/` → `PLAN_PATH` is its path relative to `REPO`. Otherwise step 6 sets `PLAN_PATH`.
4. **Slug.**
   ```bash
   SLUG=$(python3 -c 'import re,sys; s=sys.argv[1].rsplit("/",1)[-1].lower().removesuffix(".md"); s=re.sub(r"[^a-z0-9]+","-",s).strip("-"); s=re.sub(r"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}-","",s); print(re.sub(r"-plan$","",s) or "plan")' "$PLAN_SOURCE")
   ```
5. **Branch.** `BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)`:
   - empty (detached HEAD) → stop with `Check out a branch first.`;
   - `main` or `master` → create the first free delivery branch. Uncommitted changes move with it; step 8 stops on them.
     ```bash
     B="delivery/$SLUG"; n=2
     while git rev-parse --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$B" >/dev/null; do B="delivery/$SLUG-$n"; n=$((n+1)); done
     git switch -c "$B"
     ```
     `BRANCH` becomes `$B`.
6. **Save the plan** when `PLAN_PATH` is not set yet:
   ```bash
   DATE=$(date +%F); P="docs/plans/$DATE-$SLUG.md"; n=2
   while [ -e "$P" ]; do P="docs/plans/$DATE-$SLUG-$n.md"; n=$((n+1)); done
   mkdir -p docs/plans
   ```
   `PLAN_PATH=$P`. With `PLAN_FILE`, run `cp "$PLAN_FILE" "$PLAN_PATH"`. Without it, `read <PLAN_SOURCE>:raw` and `write` that exact text to `PLAN_PATH`.
7. **Commit the plan** when `git status --porcelain -- "$PLAN_PATH"` prints anything. The subject is `docs: update delivery plan <SLUG>` when `git ls-files --error-unmatch -- "$PLAN_PATH"` succeeds, otherwise `docs: add delivery plan <SLUG>`. Run `git add -- "$PLAN_PATH"`, then `git commit -m "<subject>" -- "$PLAN_PATH"`. A failed commit → print git's output and stop.
8. If `git status --porcelain` prints anything → stop with `Commit or stash your other changes, then run /delivery:execute <PLAN_PATH>.`
9. `TASKS` = JSON output of `python3 "$ROUTER" plan "$REPO" "$PLAN_PATH"`. A non-zero exit → stop with the router's error.
10. **Done tasks and base.**
    - `git log -F --grep="Delivery-Plan: $PLAN_PATH" --format=%B`. Every line `Delivery-Task: <N>` marks task `N` as done.
    - `BASE`: if `git log -F --grep="Delivery-Plan: $PLAN_PATH" --reverse --format=%H` prints commits, `BASE` is the parent of the first one (`git rev-parse <first>^`); otherwise `BASE=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`.
11. Any not-done task with stack `split` → stop with `Task <N> touches several stacks (<groups>). Split it in <PLAN_PATH>, commit, then run /delivery:execute <PLAN_PATH>.`
12. Route every not-done task with **Routing**. For an `unknown` task, `TASK_TEXT` is its `block`. Print the `Routing: task <N> → <agent> (source: <source>)` line for every task in your reply before starting step 2; it is the audit trail of each routing decision.
13. Every routed agent must be listed among the `task` tool's available agents. A missing one → stop with `Install <plugin>: omp plugin install <plugin>@av-marketplace, then start a new session.` (`<plugin>` is the part before `:`).
14. `todo init` with one item per not-done task, `Task <N>: <title>`, then `Plan verification` and `Final code review`.

If every task is already done, print `All tasks of <PLAN_PATH> are delivered.` and go to step 3.

### 2. Tasks

For each not-done task, in ascending order of `N`:

1. Mark its todo item in progress. Run **Task loop** with `N`, `TASK_BLOCK` = the task's `block`, `AGENT` = its routed agent, `PLAN_PATH`, `BRANCH`.
2. Act on the result:
   - `stopped` → run step 4 and end the run;
   - `skipped` → mark the todo item done and note `skipped` in the summary;
   - `approved` or `accepted-with-open-findings` → commit with `git commit -F -` and exactly this message:
     ```
     <the task's commit, or "chore: <title>" when commit is null>

     Delivery-Plan: <PLAN_PATH>
     Delivery-Task: <N>
     ```
     For `accepted-with-open-findings`, add the line `Delivery-Review: accepted-with-open-findings` directly after `Delivery-Task: <N>`. Mark the todo item done.
   - A failed commit (for example a rejecting hook) → print git's output and stop.

### 3. Verification

Mark `Plan verification` in progress. When `PLAN_PATH` has a `## Verification` section, carry out each check it lists, in order, with your own tools — commands, scripts, smoke runs — without editing project files. A check that needs a person, such as a manual UI step you cannot perform, is `manual`. Print one line per check:

```
Verification: <check> — pass | fail | manual (<evidence>)
```

Without a `## Verification` section, print `Verification: none in plan`. Any `fail` → use the `ask` tool: `Verification failed: <checks>. What now?` with options `Continue to the final review` and `Stop delivery`. `Stop delivery` → run step 4 and end the run. Mark `Plan verification` done.

### 4. Summary

Print the table `Task | Agent | Routing | Fix rounds | Result`, one row per task handled in this run, then the `Verification:` lines. The `Routing` column holds the routing source.

### 5. Final review

Mark `Final code review` in progress.

- `code-review` root is `null` → print `Install code-review@av-marketplace and run /code-review:review.` and end.
- Otherwise `read <code-review root>/commands/review.md` and carry it out completely, as if it had been invoked with this argument in place of its `$ARGUMENTS`:
  ```
  Changes on branch <BRANCH> in <BASE>..HEAD (git diff <BASE>..HEAD), delivered from <PLAN_PATH>. Review only these changes.
  ```

Mark `Final code review` done.

### 6. Fix offer

If the review saved a report, use the `ask` tool: `Run /code-review:fix-all on <report path>?` with options `Yes` and `No`. On `Yes`, `read <code-review root>/commands/fix-all.md` and carry it out completely with `$ARGUMENTS` = the report path.

## Plugin roots

Run:

```bash
omp plugin list --json | python3 -c 'import json,sys; want=sys.argv[1:]; d=json.load(sys.stdin); r={p["id"].split("@")[0]: p["entries"][0]["installPath"] for p in d.get("marketplace", []) if p.get("entries")}; print(json.dumps({w: r.get(w) for w in want}))' delivery code-review
```

- `delivery` is `null` → stop with `Install delivery: omp plugin install delivery@av-marketplace`.
- Otherwise `ROUTER` is `<delivery root>/scripts/route_task.py`; use it through `python3 "$ROUTER" ...`.
- Keep the `code-review` root; `null` means code-review is not installed.

The router prints JSON. Each task entry of `python3 "$ROUTER" plan "$REPO" <plan>` has `task`, `title`, `commit`, `block`, `files`, `stack`, `agent`, `groups`.

## Routing

Decide the implementer for each task:

- `stack` is `python`, `frontend`, `php` or `generic` → use the entry's `agent`. Source: `files`.
- `stack` is `split` → do not route; the Delivery run stops on it.
- `stack` is `unknown` (the task lists no files):
  1. Run `python3 "$ROUTER" layout "$REPO"` and keep its JSON as `LAYOUT`. If `LAYOUT["stacks"]` is empty → `delivery:implementer`, source `files`.
  2. Otherwise run this in the `eval` tool (python). Set `LAYOUT` to that JSON and `TASK_TEXT` to the task text:
     ```python
     CRIT = {"python": "Python code or its tests.", "frontend": "React/TypeScript web app code or its tests.", "php": "PHP code or its tests."}
     crit = {s: CRIT[s] for s in LAYOUT["stacks"]}
     crit["generic"] = "Work outside those stacks: docs, CI, repo configuration, Node tooling without React."
     crit["split"] = "The task needs changes in two or more of the stacks above."
     Q = {"route": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Pick the implementer for this task given the repository layout. One task should touch one stack.", "criteria": crit}}
     state = "Repository layout:\n" + "\n".join(LAYOUT["lines"]) + "\n\nTask:\n" + TASK_TEXT
     b = judge_batch({"t": state}, Q, intent="Routing a delivery task")
     got = []
     for _ in range(3):
         got = await b.drain(timeout=60)
         if got:
             break
     model = b.status()["model"]
     item = got[0][1] if got else None
     answer = item.answers["route"] if item is not None and not getattr(item, "error", None) else None
     print({"model": model, "answer": answer, "error": getattr(item, "error", None) if item is not None else "no answer"})
     ```
  3. Accept `answer["choice"]` only when all of these hold:
     - `answer` is not `None`;
     - `"jev" in model.lower()`;
     - `answer["choice"] != "split"`;
     - `answer["confidence"] >= 0.8`.

     The agent is `python` → `python-developer:developer`, `frontend` → `frontend-developer:developer`, `php` → `php-developer:developer`, `generic` → `delivery:implementer`. Source: `jev p=<confidence, 2 decimals> via <model>`.
  4. Otherwise use the `ask` tool:
     - question: `Which implementer should take Task <N>: <title>? (no file list; Jev: <choice, or the error> p=<confidence> via <model>)`;
     - options: one per stack in `LAYOUT["stacks"]`, then `generic`, then `Stop`;
     - `Stop` ends the delivery run. Any other answer maps as in step 3. Source: `user`.

For every routed task, print exactly one line:

```
Routing: task <N> → <agent> (source: <source>)
```

## Task loop

Inputs: `N`, `TASK_BLOCK`, `AGENT`, `PLAN_PATH`, `BRANCH`. `PLUGIN` is the part of `AGENT` before `:` when `AGENT` is a developer agent (`python-developer`, `frontend-developer`, `php-developer`), otherwise `none`.

Every dispatch below is one `task` tool call with one item. Wait for its result before continuing; if it has not arrived, use `hub` `wait` with the job id. Use this `context` for every item:

```
Delivery of <PLAN_PATH> on branch <BRANCH>. One task per agent; the orchestrator reviews and commits.
```

1. `TASK_BASE=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`.
2. **Implement.** Dispatch `AGENT` with the **Implementer template**.
3. **Stage.** If `git rev-parse HEAD` differs from `TASK_BASE`, the agent committed: run `git reset --soft "$TASK_BASE"`. Then run `git add -A`.
4. **Nothing to review?** If `git diff --cached --quiet` succeeds (no changes), or the report's `**Status:**` line contains `❌`, use the `ask` tool:
   - question: `Task <N> produced <no changes | a ❌ Failed report>. What now?`
   - `Retry once` → go back to step 2. Allowed once per task; after a retry, offer only the other two options;
   - `Skip this task` → `git stash push --include-untracked -m "delivery: skipped task <N>"` and return result `skipped`;
   - `Stop delivery` → leave the tree as it is and return result `stopped`.
5. **Review, round `r = 0`.** Dispatch `delivery:task-reviewer` with the **Reviewer template**. Its structured output is `{verdict, findings}`. The review is blocking when any finding has severity `critical` or `important`, whatever `verdict` says.
6. **Fix rounds.** While the review is blocking and `r < 3`:
   - `r = r + 1`;
   - dispatch `AGENT` with the **Fix template**, passing the blocking findings;
   - repeat step 3;
   - dispatch `delivery:task-reviewer` again with the Reviewer template and the previous findings.
7. **Still blocking after round 3** → use the `ask` tool:
   - question: `Task <N> still has <k> blocking findings after 3 fix rounds. What now?`
   - options: `Accept and commit with open findings` (result `accepted-with-open-findings`), `Stop delivery` (result `stopped`).
8. Not blocking → result `approved`. Return `{result, rounds: r, findings}` to the Delivery run. The Delivery run commits; this loop never does.

### Implementer template

```
You are implementing Task <N> of the plan <PLAN_PATH>.

<TASK_BLOCK>

Rules:
- Implement exactly this task. Write tests first when the task lists a Test file.
- Do not commit, stash, switch branches or rewrite history. Leave all changes in the working tree.
- End with your report, including a **Status:** line (✅ Complete | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Failed).
```

### Reviewer template

```
Review the staged changes for Task <N> of <PLAN_PATH>.
Stack plugin: <PLUGIN>

<TASK_BLOCK>
```

From round 1 on, append:

```

Findings from the previous review — verify each is resolved:
<previous findings as JSON>
```

### Fix template

```
Fix the review findings for Task <N> of <PLAN_PATH>. Your earlier implementation is staged (git diff --cached).

<TASK_BLOCK>

Findings to fix — fix exactly these, do not redo the task:
<blocking findings as JSON>

Rules:
- Implement exactly this task. Write tests first when the task lists a Test file.
- Do not commit, stash, switch branches or rewrite history. Leave all changes in the working tree.
- End with your report, including a **Status:** line (✅ Complete | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Failed).
```
