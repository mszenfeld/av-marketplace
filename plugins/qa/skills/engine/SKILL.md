# QA Engine

Load this skill before calling the engine from `/qa:run`, `/qa:create-plan` or `qa:plan-authoring`. The engine uses only the Python standard library and requires Python 3.11 or newer. On an older interpreter it exits 2 with `{"error": "Error: the qa engine needs Python 3.11 or newer (found X.Y)"}`.

## Resolve the installed script

Never use a project's own copy of `qa.py` or assume the marketplace checkout is installed in the current repository.

- **Claude Code:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/engine/scripts/qa.py`; run it exactly as `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/engine/scripts/qa.py <subcommand> ...`, without quotes around the script path, to match the command's permission pre-approval.
- **OMP:** run `realpath skill://qa:engine/scripts/qa.py` with Bash and invoke `python3 '<resolved-script>' <subcommand> ...` using the returned absolute path. An OMP shell does not define `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`; do not substitute a guessed path. Skill references here resolve with the `qa:` prefix in OMP.

Claude Code examples:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/engine/scripts/qa.py config
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/engine/scripts/qa.py tools
```

Each subcommand accepts `--repo <root>`; without it the engine uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. A multiword change source is one quoted argument, for example `plan resolve 'last 3 commits'`. The engine's switches below are internal CLI arguments, not options accepted by the flagless `/qa:run` or `/qa:create-plan` commands.

## Output and exits

Except for a successful `summary`, stdout is exactly one JSON object. Read it and the exit code together; never infer success from an empty `errors` list alone. No resolved password, token, cookie, secret or exposed value is printed. User provisioning output includes configured user names and channel paths/names only; cleanup reports emails so the user can identify registered accounts.

| Exit | Meaning | Caller action |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | The operation completed; inspect its `state`, `ok` or `decision` as applicable. | Follow the command workflow. `config` can report a missing file/table with this exit; that is not a valid config. |
| `1` | Domain stop, normally `{"error": "<reason>"}` with optional diagnostic fields. `plan check` instead returns its complete `ok: false` gaps/guard result. | Route the stop or gaps through `/qa:run`; after `run start`, still run teardown. Never patch state to bypass the stop. |
| `2` | Usage error or invalid config. `config` lists every validation error with its file/key; preview validation returns `ok: false` and `errors`. Other failures return `{"error": "<reason>"}`. | Show the error; do not run a config recipe. `/qa:create-plan` may author with `Config: none` when `config` returned a recognized non-`ok` state. |

Sources are validated, not executed, by `config`. Resolution happens only after trust, through users, services and cleanup. Errors name keys/sources, never their values. Successful commands log only exit/line-count summaries. Failure output belongs only in the engine-private `engine.log`, never in the orchestrator's answer: unresolved or short values may remain in its masked tails. Do not read the log into the transcript.

## Subcommands and JSON shapes

The shapes below name object fields; `[]` means an array, `{}` a map, `?` an optional field, and `null` an absent value. Paths and IDs returned by the engine are authoritative.

### Configuration and trust

| Subcommand | JSON output |
|---|---|
| `config` | `{state, errors[], warnings[], provenance{}, trust, trust_hash, trust_subset, targets{}, defaults{FE, BE}, policy{fix, mutations, start_services}, services{health[], up, prepare[], down}, users{<name>: <description>}, values[], exposed[], stores{<name>: {kind, engine?}}}`. Unconfigured service keys are reported as `health: []`, `up: null`, `prepare: []` and `down: null`. On invalid config the metadata after `trust_subset` may be absent. |
| `trust accept <hash>` | `{trusted: hash}`. Exit 1 if the current trust subset hashes differently. |
| `config preview <proposal>` | `{ok, errors[], diff, gitignore_add[]?, trust_subset, trust_hash, snapshot}`. Writes nothing. |
| `config apply <proposal> --snapshot S --approved-hash H` | `{applied}`. Uses the preview's snapshot and approved hash. |
| `tools` | `{curl, jq, perl_json_pp, psql, mysql, sqlite3, redis_cli, httpie}`; every field is a boolean (`redis_cli` checks `redis-cli`). Browser availability requires a separate browser probe. |

- `gitignore_add` is present only when `ok` is true.
- When `ok` is true, `diff` is a unified-diff string of the masked, parsed config and any `.gitignore` additions; config comments are enforced by the section guard, not shown in the diff. Otherwise, `diff` is `[]`.

`state` is `missing-file`, `missing-table`, `invalid` or `ok`. `trust` is `not-required`, `new`, `trusted` or `changed`; only `trusted`/`not-required` permits `run start`. `provenance` identifies `.av/config.toml` or `.av/local.toml` for effective keys. `users` contains descriptions, `stores` contains kind/engine only, and `values` / `exposed` contain names only. `exposed` lists sorted `QA_<U>_EMAIL`, `QA_<U>_PASSWORD`, configured `QA_<U>_ID`, `QA_<X>` for every value and `QA_NEW_PASSWORD`. Show `trust_subset` for the one trust question, not the raw config or a source's output.

`<proposal>` is a path to a JSON transaction:

```json
{"config_text": "<full proposed .av/config.toml>", "gitignore_add": [".av/local.toml", ".av/secrets.local.env"], "allowed_keys": ["<keys this transaction may change>"]}
```

Preview accepts only the exact `.av/local.toml` and `.av/secrets.local.env` strings in `gitignore_add`; other paths, negations and wildcards are rejected. It validates the merged proposal, treating those paths as ignored. Its `diff` includes the masked config changes and every `.gitignore` addition, without unrelated existing ignore-file context; show the complete diff before approval. Only `allowed_keys` may change; other table sections, including comments, remain byte-identical. Its opaque `snapshot` captures the current config and `.gitignore` bytes. Apply aborts without writes if either differs from that snapshot; otherwise it writes both atomically, revalidates and records trust only if the result hashes to `H`. A failed validation/hash check restores the original bytes only while the files still equal the engine's own writes; concurrent edits are left intact and reported as a conflict. Never apply without the preview approval.

### Plans

| Subcommand | JSON output |
|---|---|
| `plan resolve [ARG]` | `{action: "reuse"|"stale"|"generate", plan, branch, head, source, changed_files[]}`. `plan` is `null` when generation is needed. |
| `plan check <plan>` | `{ok, sections{FE[], BE[]}, users[], registrations[], values[], missing{users[{name, token, reason}], values[], targets[], stores[], cleanup}, off_target[], plan_errors[{scenario, reason}], guarded[], state_checks{<scenario>: [<store>]}}`. `missing.cleanup` is a boolean soft gap and does not affect `ok`; all other missing lists, `off_target` and `plan_errors` must be empty for `ok: true`. |

An existing argument path is reused; a change source requests generation. With no argument, resolution selects the newest plan whose Source `Branch:` matches the current branch, otherwise generation. Detached HEAD generates. A selected plan is stale if its Source `Head:` is not an ancestor of HEAD, or the intervening diff touches a file outside `docs/`; `changed_files` explains that decision.

Plan checks derive users and values from `$QA_NAME` / `${QA_NAME}` tokens anywhere in scenarios, including preconditions and edges, and declarations under `## Users`. They distinguish configured existing users from tester-registered users, reject token/cookie plan fields and undeclared users, check scenario targets and strict `ui`/`backend` section origins (a single target serves both), every absolute URL's exact origin, cleartext credential origins, repeatable BE-only State Checks and mutation policy. Unknown store/value/user configuration is a config gap; invalid user declarations/tokens and ambiguous unprefixed checks are plan errors, not a tester's runtime credential request. `off_target` identifies scenario/origin/reason; `guarded` contains scenario IDs. Under `deny`, every scenario with `Writes: yes`, missing/invalid Writes or syntactically detected writes is guarded, including registration/preconditions; `allow` guards nothing. State Check store lists retain line order.

Each configured user declared `registered` is reported once in `plan_errors` with `scenario: "plan"`, even when no scenario references that user. Scenario-specific token errors retain their scenario IDs.

The parser keeps original scenario blocks and assertion text for testers and reports. Preconditions remain part of the action, credential and URL scans; citation tags stay in assertion text but are excluded when extracting HTTP statuses. Neither needs a separate parsed metadata field. Exact-origin plan checks use the shared `av_config.origins.parse_origin` normalizer directly.

### Run, services and users

| Subcommand | JSON output |
|---|---|
| `run start <plan> [--generated] [--baseline-run <old_run_id> \| --baseline-file <file>] [--takeover <run_id>]` | `{run, dir, sidecar, report, idempotency: "reuse"|"adopt"|"fresh"|"rebaseline"}`. |
| `run end --run ID` | `{released}`; releases target/store locks and deletes this run's private directory. |
| `run stop --run ID --reason <user-abort\|config-drift\|plan-changed\|cleanup-error\|other> [--detail TEXT]` | `{decision: "stop", reason, detail}`; records a stop and closes any open iteration, without config drift checks. |
| `services check --run ID` | `{up, probes[{target, path, status}]}`. |
| `services up --run ID` | `{ran, exit}`. |
| `services prepare --run ID` | `{ran, exit}`. |
| `services down --run ID` | `{ran, exit}`; does nothing unless this run executed `up`. |
| `users provision --run ID` | `{users[], exposed[], secrets_env, secrets_json, redact_names, loader}`. |
| `users record --run ID --dispatch D --email E [--id I]` | `{recorded: true}`; exit 1 with `{"error": "<reason>"}` for `email not tagged for this dispatch`, `invalid email`, `invalid id` or `configured user`. |
| `users teardown --run ID` | `{deleted[], left[], manual[]}`; lists emails. |

`run start` refuses untrusted config with `trust required`. It records the effective config, its hash and its accepted trust hash in the run directory; public metadata masks literal sources, and no resolved value goes in the sidecar. It creates a mode-0700 `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/qa-run-<run-id>/`, removes this repository's private run directories older than 24 hours and takes sorted locks for target origins plus store endpoint keys: `sql:<host lower>:<port>/<name>`, `sql:<absolute sqlite path>` or `redis:<host lower>:<port>/<db>`. Identical configured keys cannot run concurrently; undeclared stores and host aliases are not coordinated. A live lock lasts until release or 30 minutes + 15 minutes; explicit, approved `--takeover <holder-run-id>` also removes that holder's private directory, but its account ledger survives.

`--generated` always records `auto_generated: true`, including reuse or adoption of a report without provenance. Without the flag a fresh/rebaselined sidecar records `false`; reuse keeps the sidecar's stored value, and adoption keeps the report's `- Plan provenance:` value (an older report without provenance is treated as existing). `/qa:run` passes the flag only when Step 2 generated/regenerated the selected plan in this invocation, including start retries/restarts. Summary's all-SKIP/NEED_INFO and shallow-coverage branches read this recorded value.

To keep bootstrap writes out of the dirty baseline, `/qa:run` captures tracked-modified paths before Step 1 writes anything and saves a JSON array in a temporary file outside the repository. `--baseline-file <file>` uses exactly those paths as `pre_loop_dirty` and fingerprints them before fix work; it preserves config/gitignore paths already dirty before invocation. With neither baseline option, `run start` reads the current tracked tree. On repair restart, `--baseline-run <ended-run-id>` instead loads the same plan's recorded paths **and fingerprints** from its durable sidecar, so it works after `run end` deleted the private directory. A missing/mismatched baseline is an error, never permission to silently snapshot a new tree. The baseline inputs are mutually exclusive. New bootstrap-only dirt in `.av/config.toml` / `.gitignore` is excluded from both pre-existing dirt and scoped fix recovery.

Engine logs and `run stop` details use `SecretSet`: collect literal values and environment values referenced by `env:` sources in the recorded or current config, plus strings in `secrets.json` only, where the only `STORE_*` entries collected are `*_PGPASSWORD`, `*_MYSQL_PWD` and `*_REDISCLI_AUTH` (store hosts, ports, user and database names, sqlite paths, `REDIS_DB` and `PGOPTIONS` are public config and stay readable). Collection never resolves file/command sources or executes commands. Runtime adds resolved source values as they become available. Mask raw and JSON-escaped strings longest-first; public targets/probes/policy and unrelated environment values stay readable. Engine logs mask only known values of at least four characters, then truncate each failure entry to its last 2048 characters; successful sources, services and command recipes retain only exit/line-count summaries, not stdout/stderr. Only values known to the writing process are masked: unresolved configured values, undeclared secrets and shorter values may remain in failure tails. Treat `engine.log` as engine-private, not transcript-safe. Stop details still mask known secrets of any length before flattening.

Every post-start stop/abort records `run stop` before report flush and teardown. `--detail` must contain only sanitized diagnostics/names/statuses, never secret values or raw recipe output. Whitespace is flattened to one line after masking. Repeat calls preserve the first stop reason. A recorded stop always yields `**Result:** Stopped` with its reason/detail, regardless of PASS verdicts, and never writes new Status lines, even on a later `report --final`. Existing Status lines are preserved.

`users provision`, `services check|up|prepare` and `dispatch` compare the current config against the run-bound config. `config changed during run` stops the run; teardown is still mandatory. `users teardown`, `services down` and `run end` skip that comparison. Services down uses the recorded, previously trusted command; registered-account cleanup uses current config only when valid and `trust` is `trusted` or `not-required`, with the cleanup's destination locked by this run. Otherwise accounts stay `left` without counting an attempt. `qa.start_services = "ask"` asks once before needed bring-up and headless stops; `"auto"` prints scope then runs `up` + `prepare`, independently of `qa.fix`. `prepare` runs only after QA's own `up`, must be idempotent against persistent data, and never applies branch migrations to an already-running stack.

Provisioning runs even with zero users, so every tester has a secrets channel. Only plan-referenced configured user fields, values and State Check stores are exposed, plus `QA_NEW_PASSWORD`, generated once as `secrets.token_urlsafe(18) + "Aa1!"` and reused on every provision in that run. Store client variables are namespaced `STORE_<NAME_UPPER>_<CLIENT>`: postgres `PGHOST PGPORT PGUSER PGDATABASE PGPASSWORD PGOPTIONS` (`PGOPTIONS=-c default_transaction_read_only=on`), mysql `MYSQL_HOST MYSQL_TCP_PORT MYSQL_USER MYSQL_DATABASE MYSQL_PWD`, sqlite `SQLITE_DB` (absolute), redis `REDIS_HOST REDIS_PORT REDIS_DB` plus `REDISCLI_AUTH` only with a password. `secrets.env`, `secrets.json`, `load.sh`, `capture.sh` and `redact-names` are mode 0600. Redact names include every `QA_*`, namespaced store name except `*_PGOPTIONS`, and native store aliases except `PGOPTIONS`, so masking works with or without store selection. `qa_load_store='<name>' qa_load_require='NAME...' . '<run-dir>/load.sh' || exit 1` exports that store's native aliases then checks a space-separated list of required names; an unknown store fails with `<NAME>: unknown store`, and an empty exported endpoint fails with `<NAME>: store not exported`. Omit `qa_load_store` when no native aliases are needed and use empty `qa_load_require` when no names are required. Never pass dot-script arguments: dash ignores them. Lower-case controls do not collide with exposed `QA_*` values; the loader consumes them before unsetting inherited `QA_*|PG*|MYSQL_*|SQLITE_DB|REDIS*|STORE_*`. The OMP FE cell reads `secrets.json`; never rely on inherited harness credentials or print the files. Engine-only secrets never reach testers. `QA_TAG` is not in the channel; use the dispatch's `Tag:`.

Testers register accounts with a tagged email such as `qa+<tag>-owner@test.local` and the run password. Immediately after successful registration, before another step, call `sh '<run-dir>/capture.sh' <dispatch> --account <email> [<id>]`; it invokes `users record` and writes the durable ledger outside the run directory. Non-zero exit is `NEED_INFO kind=fixture` naming the email. `accounts: [{email, id}]` in `qa-results` is only the fallback when that helper could not record. Acceptance requires email matching `[A-Za-z0-9._+-]{1,64}@[A-Za-z0-9.-]{1,253}`, the dispatch tag in its local part case-insensitively, no equality with any channel `QA_*_EMAIL`, and id either null or matching `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,128}`. Invalid entries are rejected by email; a non-list accounts value or an entry lacking a string email invalidates the whole block.

The engine-owned `<state>/av-marketplace/qa-accounts.json` ledger is keyed by repository realpath. Records carry `email`, `id`, `run_id`, `tag`, `dispatch`, `destination`, `deleted`, `status` and `attempts`; recording is idempotent on `(run_id, dispatch, email)`, only filling a missing id without resetting attempts/status. Status is `pending`, `deleted` or `manual-cleanup`. A destination records the cleanup's target origin or SQL store lock key (null without cleanup or for command); mismatches stay `left`, and a null destination takes the current destination on the first attempt. A usable recipe attempts undeleted non-manual records from any run of this repository; success marks deleted, every failure increments attempts, and the third failure moves the record to manual-cleanup, listed once in `manual`. Missing/untrusted cleanup or an unlocked destination leaves records without counting attempts. Later teardowns do not retry manual-cleanup. Run end, takeover and stale-directory cleanup delete capture files but leave the ledger intact.

Teardown validates persisted email/ID safety, dispatch tags and attempt counters before rendering a recipe. A record missing `tag` or `destination` (including QA 3.1.0 ledger records), or with malformed identity/provenance/counter fields, stays unchanged without an attempt. Report its non-empty email string in `left`; without a usable email string, report only an indexed stderr diagnostic. Missing destination is not a null destination: never adopt the current cleanup destination or infer authorization from legacy `origin`. Continue processing other eligible records; recipe/source/transport failures are isolated to the attempted record.

Teardown shares one lazily opened runtime across attempted records: successful source resolutions are cached for that call, and engine logs are flushed once on exit. Keep failures isolated per record and save each outcome before the next attempt, preserving deletions, attempt counters and manual-cleanup transitions across interruptions.

### Dispatch, results and iterations

| Subcommand | JSON output |
|---|---|
| `dispatch --run ID tester --section FE|BE --phase baseline|retry|iteration|final` | `{dispatch, scenarios[], edges{}, guarded[], tag, stores[], dispatch_count, budget_left}`. |
| `dispatch --run ID fix --qa QA-NNN` | `{dispatch, qa, scenarios[], edges{}, dispatch_count, budget_left}`. |
| `fix done --run ID --dispatch D --result fixed|partial|failed` | `{warnings[]}`. |
| `ingest --run ID --dispatch D <file>` | `{verdicts{}, need_info{}, new_failures[], regressions[], now_passing[], incomplete[], accounts{recorded, rejected[]}, error?}`. |
| `issues --run ID` | `{assign[{qa, key, scenario, observed_status, unverified, severity_floor}], open[]}`. |
| `candidates --run ID` | `{fix[{qa, key, flags[]}], dropped[{qa, reason}]}`. |
| `iteration open --run ID` | `{decision: "iterate"|"final"|"stop", iteration, reason}`. |
| `iteration close --run ID` | `{decision: "continue"|"final", reason, now_passing[], regressions[], fix_touched_files[], overlap[]}`. |

Call engine dispatches sequentially, even when FE and BE tester agents will run in parallel. A tester dispatch issues a distinct eight-hex-digit tag, records scenario IDs/planned edges and the section's State Check stores, and creates `results/<dispatch>/` mode 0700 with empty `captured.env` and a copy of `redact-names`, both 0600, before launching the tester. A dispatch logs nobody in. `sh '<run-dir>/capture.sh' <dispatch> QA_CAPTURED_<USER>_<FIELD>` reads stdin, strips one trailing newline, shell-quotes the value and appends an export and its redact name; only `QA_CAPTURED_[A-Z0-9_]+` names are accepted. Each request sources both `load.sh` and `results/<dispatch>/captured.env`; after capture, source captured.env again before sanitising that same response against the dispatch's redact-names. A fix dispatch records the engine-assigned QA ID; `fix done` records its outcome and computes warnings for added literals matching the failed BE request payload.

Save a tester's complete answer to a file in `<run-dir>/results/` and pass it to `ingest`. Only its final fenced `json qa-results` block is parsed. The section must match the dispatch; every assigned scenario and planned edge must appear exactly once. Missing items become `cannot-confirm`, never an earlier retained PASS; duplicates or a wrong section invalidate the block. Invalid/missing blocks yield cannot-confirm results plus `error`, not permission to invent results. Tester status is `PASS|FAIL|SKIP|NEED_INFO`; a need-info kind is `credentials|service|fixture|tool` or `null`. Let `ingest` compute precedence, reasons, auth classification and regressions.

For a BE feature main flow expecting 2xx but returning 401/403, the verdict is always FAIL flagged `auth`: `approve` may offer it for a reviewed fix; `auto` drops it, as it drops an unverified assertion. The engine logs nobody in. Never weaken an authentication or authorization check to make a scenario pass.

`issues` owns key-based QA-ID allocation. Status >= 500 or `crash` forces `severity_floor: "CRITICAL"`; an unverified assertion otherwise forces LOW; other floors are `null` for the orchestrator's evidence-based severity. `candidates` owns prefilters, flags and guards. `iteration open` rehashes the plan, checks remaining failures and the fixed limits, snapshots verdicts and increments only on `iterate`. `iteration close` compares against that snapshot and writes exactly one history row with fixes and warnings; `fix_touched_files` excludes pre-existing dirty files and `overlap` names those that also changed. Route `stop` to teardown, `final` to the final test pass and `continue` to the next open; never increment counters by hand.

**Dangling-iteration rule (engine-owned):** `run stop`, `report --final` and `summary` automatically close an open iteration for bookkeeping only: the history row records `decision: "closed"` and `reason: "iteration closed at exit"` without deciding or changing `loop_end`. Only explicit `iteration close` decides progress/regression/budget routing. The CLI persists this closure before rendering/recording the exit, so even a failed final-report request does not leave an iteration open. This covers **Skip to final run**, an empty fix-set and every stop after `dispatch … fix`, recording exactly one history row, touched paths, overlap and warnings. Skip and empty fix-set leave the final verdict authoritative, not an inferred no-progress stop. A dispatched fix without `fix done` is recorded as `failed`, not an inferred success; its anti-hardcoding check still runs (or a plan-drift warning records why it could not). A later render includes the row in Loop History.

### Reports and summary

| Subcommand | Output |
|---|---|
| `report --run ID --issues <file> [--final]` | JSON `{report, fixed[], written}`. |
| `report --run ID --accounts` | JSON `{report}`; updates only the Summary's `- Accounts:` line from the ledger, not verdicts or Status lines. Do not combine it with `--final`. |
| `summary --run ID` | Markdown, not JSON: `**Result:** Pass|Fail|Budget Exhausted|Stopped`, counts, Coverage, unlock hints, budget usage and scoped recovery. Relay it without recomputing the result. |

The orchestrator writes **only issue prose** as a separate JSON list, using IDs from `issues`:

```json
[{"qa": "QA-001", "title": "<issue>", "severity": "HIGH", "location": "<path:line>", "actual": "<sanitized observation>", "impact": "<effect>", "remediation": "<fix guidance>"}]
```

Optional fields are `severity_reason`, `response` and `screenshot`. Use CRITICAL beyond a mechanical floor only with `severity_reason: "security-bypass"|"data-loss"` and supporting evidence in `actual`. `report` rejects unassigned IDs, a lowered mechanical CRITICAL, an unsupported CRITICAL or an unverified issue raised above LOW without >= 500/crash. It copies Expected with its grounding tag and Refutation itself; never fabricate those in issue prose. An empty list is valid when there are no new issue prose entries.

Issue prose cannot contain a standalone `**Name:**` report-field line, including `-`/`*` bullet prefixes and leading spaces or tabs. Quote such app output inline instead. Validation uses the shared report-field grammar and rejects the issue list before replacing an existing report, so prose cannot supply Status or Scenario metadata.

The engine preserves existing `**Status:**`, `**Decision:**`, `**Decision-retired:**`, `**Verification-plan:**`, `**Decision-pin:**`, `**Dispatch:**`, `**Verification:**` and a rewritten `**Location:**` by QA token. Final write-back requires a whole-scenario PASS, never overwrites `🚫 Rejected` and never marks a partial fix as fixed.

Status, Location and decision metadata are read only before `**Category:**`; bare fields and `-`/`*` bullet-prefixed fields use the same grammar in candidates, adoption, summaries and final write-back. Body text that resembles those fields cannot override header metadata. Scenario, Problem and Remediation are read from the full issue block.

The summary's result is engine-computed: plan drift/recorded stops take priority and print their reason; with remaining failures, no-progress/regression stops are `Stopped`, exhausted budgets are `Budget Exhausted`, otherwise `Fail`. With no such failures it is `Pass`, except an all-SKIP/NEED_INFO human-authored plan is `Stopped`. Pass is not a claim of full verification: always relay Coverage and unlock hints for unverified or shallow coverage. Fail routes to the reported remaining issues; Budget Exhausted routes to the exhausted fixed limits and a rerun; Stopped routes to its reason before any rerun.

## Ownership boundary

**The orchestrator never writes or edits the sidecar or the report by hand.** This includes counters, verdicts, baseline, need-info maps, QA IDs, iteration history, Status lines and preserved decision fields. No `jq` patch, wholesale state rewrite, direct report edit or invented PASS is allowed. Read them when needed; call the appropriate engine subcommand to change them.

The sidecar remains `docs/testing/reports/<topic>-loop-state.json` and carries `run_id`; account cleanup lives in the external ledger, independently of report or sidecar rebaselining. The model coordinates planning, testing, fixing and sanitized issue prose; the engine owns all deterministic bookkeeping and report rendering. Once `run start` succeeds, every stop/error/abort path still tears down accounts, refreshes the Accounts report line, stops services this run started, prints the summary and calls `run end`.
